I thought `getUserMedia` needs Safari Technology Preview. Got it from https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/. No luck due to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158393.

Googling suggests that it is non-trivial to get an alternate. Use Chrome for this exercise.

If you find your webcam wedged on OSX/macOS, try `sudo killall VDCAssistant`.
